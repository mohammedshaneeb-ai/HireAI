# Hire AI

Hire AI is a machine learning-based project leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist both recruiters and job seekers. This project aims to streamline the hiring process by addressing several common challenges on both sides.

## The Problem

### For Job Seekers:
1. **Manual Data Entry**: Applicants often have to fill in details such as name, email, phone number, education, and skills manually, which is time-consuming.
2. **Resume Matching Uncertainty**: Job seekers often don't know how well their resume matches a job description, leading to the possibility of their resume not being shortlisted.
3. **Job Description Overload**: Reading and understanding long job descriptions can be time-consuming.

### For Recruiters:
1. **High Volume of Applicants**: Posting a job on a job portal can result in many applicants, making it difficult to read all resumes, shortlist candidates, and schedule interviews.
2. **Human Error**: Recruiters might miss out on good applicants due to the inability to thoroughly review all resumes, leading to potential human error.

## How Hire AI Solves These Problems

### For Job Seekers:
1. **Automated Data Extraction**: Hire AI extracts all relevant information such as name, email, phone number, education, and skills from the applicant's uploaded resume, reducing manual entry.
2. **Job Match Score**: Applicants can see how well their resume matches a job post, identify missing elements, and receive suggestions for improvement.
3. **Job Description Summary**: Hire AI provides a concise summary of the job description, saving applicants time.

### For Recruiters:
1. **Smart Shortlisting**: Recruiters can shortlist resumes using simple natural language prompts and questions related to job descriptions and applicant resumes. Examples of queries include:
    - Shortlist top applicants.
    - Shortlist top 2 applicants.
    - Shortlist applicants with a score above 80%.
    - Shortlist applicants with more than 2 years of experience.
    - Shortlist applicants with skills in prompt engineering.
    - Count the number of applicants.
2. **Comprehensive Screening**: The system thoroughly reviews all resumes, ensuring good applicants are not overlooked and reducing human error.
